## Description

The Pig-Dice game is a fun game based on two players rolling a dice.

A player rolls the die until either:

1. A one is rolled
2. The player chooses to hold i.e. stop rolling

When a one is rolled, accumulated points are discarded and the other player takes over the dice.

When Hold is pressed, the accumulated points are added to the player's final Score.

### The first player that reached to 50 will be Winner!
